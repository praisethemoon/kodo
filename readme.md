# berserk
berserk is a new general purpose programming language aiming to reduce development time and increase productivity.

```
import std.io

function main(args: String[]) -> int {
	io.println("hello, world")
	return 0
}
```

the language is multi-paradigm supporting the following features
   - Object Oriented (not purely though)
   - Procedural
   - Functional 
   - Generic
   - Concurrent
   - Operator overloading
   - Statically typed (strong type checking)
   - Easy FFI (can easily communicate with C)

# Contributing
The language is still in its early development stages. The compiler is being written in C/C++ and LLVM is being used as backend. You can either contribute straight to the source code or request feature or file a bug. For more information feel free to contact me.
